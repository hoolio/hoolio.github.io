            I was born and raised in San Francisco. I'm the middle child, but it
            hasn't been as tough as the books and movies make it out to be. I
            have one older and one younger sister. I get along and have a lot of
            fun with both of them. When I was six, our family made a big move to
            Madrid, Spain, where I spent two years at an independent British
            school. After two years, we returned to California, but instead of
            going back to San Francisco, we settled in the wilder hills of Marin
            County and started a homeschool with independent teachers.

            In just a few years, I'd gone from a French school in San Francisco,
            to a British school in Madrid, a homeschool in the woods, and, now,
            also an online school with Stanford. For me, it's been great. It was
            a beautiful change of scenery. Homeschooling offered a different
            pace of life and a chance to explore my interests in a more flexible
            environment. There are trails all over my neighborhood and I started
            hiking and long-distance trail running. I loved trail running so
            much that I joined a club and started competing in races.

            In my free time, I love to read and write. I read everything from
            American fantasy to Japanese manga, along with classics and
            everything else, in between. I also like drawing, coding, building,
            and learning and making music. Iâ€™ve been taking piano and electronic
            music production for years!
